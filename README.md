# About

Welcome to [my GitHub](https://github.com/marciogualtieri?tab=repositories). In this document you will find my most relevant projects (skill-wise) highlighted. Feel free to explore all my public repositories, but bare in mind that any projects not mentioned here are likely a work in progress and thus may be incomplete.

## Programming

I'm a [clean coder](http://cleancoders.com) and thus I follow clean code principles, which include [TDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development): I write tests first (unit and integration). I also follow [BDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development) ([JBehave](http://jbehave.org/) for Java and [ScalaTest's FunSpec](http://www.scalatest.org/user_guide/tests_as_specifications) for Scala).

Follow samples of my work that represent some of my coding skills:

* Object Oriented Design: [Supermarket Pricing](https://github.com/marciogualtieri/Katas/tree/master/SupermarketPricing).

* Algorithm Design and Analysis: [Java-Paintshop](https://github.com/marciogualtieri/Java-PaintShop).

* BDD: [Processor](https://github.com/marciogualtieri/Processor) or [Summarizer](https://github.com/marciogualtieri/Summarizer).

* Web TDD: [Slightly](https://github.com/marciogualtieri/Slightly).

* Scala: [TwitterGitHubGrid](https://github.com/marciogualtieri/TwitterGitHubGrid), [Scala-Paintshop](https://github.com/marciogualtieri/Scala-PaintShop), [PersonService](https://github.com/marciogualtieri/PersonService) and [Reader](https://github.com/marciogualtieri/reader).

* Clojure: [Clojure-Paintshop](https://github.com/marciogualtieri/Clojure-PaintShop).

* Android: [Reader](https://github.com/marciogualtieri/reader).

* Practice Sessions: [Katas](https://github.com/marciogualtieri/Katas). A great tecnique to sharpen TDD skills (doesn't hurt that they are fun to do too).

## Data Science

I have completed a number of courses from [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) and [EdX](https://www.edx.org/) on the subjects of machine learning, statistics and data analytics (using tools such as Spark, R and Python). You will find a list of my certified courses on my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marcio-gualtieri-999773b).

Follow samples of my work that represent some of my data science skills:

* Binary Classification (Machine Learning): [Titanic Survivorship Analysis (Kaggle Challenge)](https://www.kaggle.com/gualtieri/titanic/titanic-survivorship-analysis). You will also find my R notebook on [GitHub](https://github.com/marciogualtieri/DataScience/tree/master/kaggle/titanic).

* Multi-class Classification (Machine Learning): [Workout: Dumbbell Lift Classification](https://marciogualtieri.github.io/DataScience/coursera/workout/scripts/workout.nb.html). You will also find my R notebook on [GitHub](https://github.com/marciogualtieri/DataScience/tree/gh-pages/coursera/workout).

* Interactive Plots (Leaflet, Plotly): [Fake News: A Graphical Exploration](https://marciogualtieri.github.io/DataScience/coursera/fakenews/scripts/fakenews.nb.html). You will also find my R notebook on [GitHub](https://github.com/marciogualtieri/DataScience/tree/gh-pages/coursera/fakenews).

* Data Product Development & Text-Mining: [ShinySide: A Text-Mining Tool Developed with Shiny](https://github.com/marciogualtieri/shinySide). You may demo the [app hosted on shinyapps.io](https://marciogualtieri.shinyapps.io/shinyside/). A [slidify presentation](https://marciogualtieri.github.io/ShinySide/presentation/index.html) is also available.

* Basic Inferential Analysis: [ToothGrowth Analysis](https://marciogualtieri.github.io/DataScience/coursera/statistics/inferentialanalysis.nb.html) & [CLT Simulation](https://marciogualtieri.github.io/DataScience/coursera/statistics/simulation.nb.html).
