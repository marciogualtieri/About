# About

Welcome to [my GitHub](https://github.com/marciogualtieri?tab=repositories). In this document you will find my most relevant projects (skill-wise) highlighted. Feel free to explore all my public repositories, but bare in mind that any projects not mentioned here are likely a work in progress and thus may be incomplete.

## Programming

I'm a [clean coder](http://cleancoders.com) and thus I follow clean code principles, which include [TDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development): I write tests first (unit and integration). I also follow [BDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development) ([JBehave](http://jbehave.org/) for Java and [ScalaTest's FunSpec](http://www.scalatest.org/user_guide/tests_as_specifications) for Scala).

Follow samples of my work that represent some of my coding skills:

* Object Oriented Design: [Supermarket Pricing](https://github.com/marciogualtieri/Katas/tree/master/SupermarketPricing).

* Algorithm Design and Analysis: [Java-Paintshop](https://github.com/marciogualtieri/Java-PaintShop).

* BDD: [Processor](https://github.com/marciogualtieri/Processor) or [Summarizer](https://github.com/marciogualtieri/Summarizer).

* Web TDD: [Slightly](https://github.com/marciogualtieri/Slightly).

* Scala: [TwitterGitHubGrid](https://github.com/marciogualtieri/TwitterGitHubGrid), [Scala-Paintshop](https://github.com/marciogualtieri/Scala-PaintShop), [PersonService](https://github.com/marciogualtieri/PersonService) and [Reader](https://github.com/marciogualtieri/reader).
