# Repository's Readme

I'm a [clean coder](http://cleancoders.com), thus I follow clean code principles, which encompass [TDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development). I always write my tests first and all my projects always include unit and integration tests. Some projects use [BDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development) ([JBehave](http://jbehave.org/) for Java and [ScalaTest's FunSpec](http://www.scalatest.org/user_guide/tests_as_specifications) for Scala).
