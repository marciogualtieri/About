#About

Welcome to [my GitHub](https://github.com/marciogualtieri?tab=repositories). In this document you will find my most relevant projects (skill-wise) highlighted. Feel free to explore all my public repositories, but bare in mind that any projects not mentioned here are likely a work in progress and thus may be incomplete.

## Programming

I'm a [clean coder](http://cleancoders.com), thus I follow clean code principles, which encompass [TDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development). I always write my tests first and all my projects always include unit and integration tests. Some projects use [BDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development) ([JBehave](http://jbehave.org/) for Java and [ScalaTest's FunSpec](http://www.scalatest.org/user_guide/tests_as_specifications) for Scala). Follow samples of my code that represent some of my coding skills:

* Object Oriented Design: [Supermarket Pricing](https://github.com/marciogualtieri/Katas/tree/master/SupermarketPricing).

* Algorithm Design and Analysis: [Java-Paintshop](https://github.com/marciogualtieri/Java-PaintShop).

* BDD: [Processor](https://github.com/marciogualtieri/Processor) or [Summarizer](https://github.com/marciogualtieri/Summarizer).

* Web TDD: [Slightly](https://github.com/marciogualtieri/Slightly).

* Scala: [Scala-Paintshop](https://github.com/marciogualtieri/Scala-PaintShop) or [PersonService](https://github.com/marciogualtieri/PersonService).

* Clojure: [Clojure-Paintshop](https://github.com/marciogualtieri/Clojure-PaintShop).

* Practice Sessions: [Katas](https://github.com/marciogualtieri/Katas). A great tecnique to sharpen TDD skills (doesn't hurt that they are fun to do too).

## Data Science

I have completed a number of courses from [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) and [edX](https://www.edx.org/) on the subjects of statistics, data analysis and data science tools (Spark and R), which are present in my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marcio-gualtieri-999773b). I can't share the course projects publicly, so I'm working on an independent project that I can showcase.
